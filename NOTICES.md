Notices after first review: 
 - general: primary keys should have name "id" not "[table-name]_id";
 - instead of BLOB, keep path to files (we will put files in file structure);
 - name fields (expand to 255 - limit 50 is always problematic for such fields)
 - all description fields should be largen than 255
 - providers does not have address in documentation;
 - provider missing links, summary
 - program: highlight - idea was to put textare (that will be treat it by JS markup editor)
 - add dictornary for status or use ENUM (we can discuss all of pros/cons of this 2 ways)
 - offer: "volonteer type" should be many to many to ditionary
 - don't use abrevations like "init_vac_cnt", "req_set" - try to have readable names;
 - offer misisng "term" (+ should be as dictionary), "limits" (add dict of all limits + relation between + additional field for value)
 - rquirements does not have value field
